# PyChatServer
TCP/IP Socket Chat Server using IPV4 INET Socket types. This chat application demonstrates socket programming using the client/server model. The server creates a socket that binds to the network's port number and public IP address. They act as the interior endpoints for sending/recieving data. The network protocol for the exchange of data is TCP (requring a three-way handshake) and uses the port 5050. Each packet of data uses 1024 bytes which is encoded/decoded using 'utf-8'.
